If you want to test the violability of the idea, you will need an MVP that has to be launched as fast as possible. By the way, it would be nice not to sell a flat or a kidney to invest in development. Anar, our client, works in a trucking business. He engaged in transportation over the USA. \n\nThe issue is the driver can’t just reach the client and ship the cargo from point A to B. Under the US law, a broker must be inculcated into this process, and the deal must be executed on a lot of paperwork. Apart from the contract with a broker, it is necessary to write down the stages manually: from approving the receiving of a cargo to making a delivery report.\n\nAnar came up with the idea to build a service that will provide drivers and clients with interaction and replace the services of brokers, reducing the number of intermediate interactions in a document flow and making it completely online.

According to the idea of a creator, the platform complies with documents and allows each of the parties to sign them; you just need to have the status of a digital broker to comply with legislation.\n\nIn the USA and Canada, the market for cargo transportation is the same, but the legislation in these countries is different. Therefore, we decided to confine ourselves only to the USA. Moreover, we decided to focus on small cargo and small cars (ordinary trucks and refrigerators).

According to statistics, 90% of startups fail due to a variety of reasons. As a result,  the costs of hiring a team of developers or cooperating with outsourcing service providers are not covered.\n\nIt is worth considering no-code development platforms. The advantages are obvious. There is no need to outsource the work. It may turn out to be much more expensive than using no-code tools. Any startup can afford to benefit from these tools and launch a groundbreaking product. Imagine that the budget that you need in this case is half the price you would pay to developers. Thus, it means that you will break into a market much faster than your competitors.\n\nYou can use low-code and no-code tools at all stages of product development. Yet, it’s especially important and helpful in the early stages. Let us consider how you can apply no-code technologies at every step.', 'Oct 31, 2022 1:12 pm', 'Nov 4, 2022 2:43 pm'),

At this point, you offer your target audience some solution to a definite problem they have. Using a certain no-code platform, you create a sample of your product. It may have limited functionality. Still, it has all the necessary features of the future product. And it will be enough to offer this version to people to test the idea you want to promote. So, you work on the design of your product and then move to the next stage.\n\nThe second step is to build a prototype of your product. At this stage, you will find out more about the features of your future product and its functionality. No-code tools allow the creation of several versions of the prototype. Using them, you will highlight the value proposition of your product to potential clients or investors. \n\nOnce you have the prototype, you can move on to developing a minimum viable product (MVP). It will help you sell your product to the first clients and get feedback on changes in your business model. At this point, you select several no-code tools that are integrated to create the necessary solution. \n\nThe next stage deals with building advanced versions of the product and scaling your business. There are no-code cloud-based tools at your disposal to achieve the goal.\n\nAs you can see, no-code instruments allow creating MVP to test your business idea. You can do it without having coding knowledge. It will be much faster and more affordable. Moreover, you will use fewer resources to define the way of growing your startup. \n\nOn the one hand, it is possible to do everything on your own. On the other hand, it is advisable to turn to a team of professionals who have been working with these technologies for a long time. There are a lot of different platforms and instruments. It will take time to examine them and choose the ones that meet your requirements. Moreover, if you have no experience in working with these tools, it will be difficult for you to choose the appropriate ones.\n\nDo you want to get an MVP and confirm your startup idea in 10 days?\nHaving opted for Swiftle, you will get assistance from highly experienced no-code developers.

What is the best option for a particular business?\nThere is no clear answer to this question. If you need a web app, a marketplace for designers’ projects or some kind of CRM, both no-code and low-code tools are perfect to implement these ideas. Still, it’s necessary to analyze the complexity of the project. \n\nClosed vs Open System\n\nWith no-code instruments, you can be a bit limited in your abilities and creativity. Any no-code platform is a kind of closed system. You benefit from a certain set of templates and plugins available within this system. However, you can create quite functional and powerful products. For instance, the Bubble platform allows enriching the products with a variety of custom elements let alone API integrations.  \n\nOne of the advantages of low-code technologies is that they give you even more freedom. Low-code platforms are the so-called ‘open’ system. Developers can change the code whenever necessary at any step of product development. Moreover, these tools boast extensive component libraries. One can create more sophisticated products.\n\nAn excellent example of low-code instruments in action is a student-tutor communication platform. With the help of this platform, one can easily schedule classes and communicate with teachers. Our developers used the Bubble platform, as well as integrated Google Forms and Google Sheets. Besides this, they take advantage of custom code to create a virtual whiteboard. The iFrame made it possible to add video chat Jitsi between teacher and student. This HTML element allows embedding documents, videos, interactive media files, and other pieces of content from different sources on a web page.\n\nAs you can see, low-code technologies are more flexible and, as a result, more powerful.\nThus, both no-code and low-code technologies are successfully used to create a variety of IT products.

For years, the barrier to entry for starting a tech company was high, with entrepreneurs needing to have a solid understanding of coding or the resources to hire developers to build their products.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the no-code movement has democratized entrepreneurship, enabling anyone with an idea to create a digital product without the need for coding skills. In this blog post, we''ll explore the sixth chapter of [i]The Cold Start Problem" by Andrew Chen[/i]. Haven’t read this book yet? Well, you certainly should! Whether you''re a seasoned entrepreneur or someone with a passion for building products, read on to learn more about growth and user acquisition, why no-code is the best option for startups, and how it can help you turn your dreams into reality.', 'Mar 22, 2023 1:30 pm', 'Mar 22, 2023 1:33 pm'),

So, what are network effects? In simple terms, they occur when the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. This creates a virtuous cycle in which more users attract more users, leading to exponential growth. For example, social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn become more valuable as more people join them since users can connect with more people and access more content.\n\nHow can it help you to launch a successful startup? Here are some reasons why you need to read this book:\n\n• Understand the fundamentals of growth: The book covers various topics related to startup growth, including customer acquisition, product-market fit, metrics, and more.\n\n• Stay up-to-date on the latest trends: The startup world is constantly evolving, and it can be difficult for startups to keep up with the latest trends and best practices.\n\n• Get practical advice and tips: The book is full of practical advice and tips that startups can apply to their businesses. From how to design a referral program to how to measure product-market fit, startups can find actionable insights that they can use to improve their growth strategies.\n\n• Avoid common pitfalls: Finally, the book can help startups avoid common pitfalls and mistakes that can derail their growth efforts.', 'Mar 22, 2023 1:31 pm', 'Mar 22, 2023 1:34 pm'),

By using these tools to iterate and launch new features rapidly, startups can more easily create the kind of platform or marketplace that can benefit from network effects, potentially leading to exponential growth and a dominant position in their market.\n\nNo-code tools allow non-technical founders and teams [b]to build and launch their products quickly[/b], often by using pre-built templates and modules. This can be especially useful for startups looking to leverage network effects, as they can quickly build and test their products without needing to invest heavily in custom development.', 'Mar 22, 2023 1:34 pm', 'Mar 22, 2023 1:35 pm'),

One of the keys to Uber''s success was its ability to quickly onboard new drivers and riders onto its platform, which allowed it to create a network effect where more drivers attracted more riders, and vice versa. No-code tools can be useful for startups looking to achieve a similar effect, as they can quickly build and launch products that attract users and generate network effects.\n\nAdditionally, no-code tools can be useful for [b]building referral programs and other growth strategies[/b] that can help startups leverage network effects. Chen discusses how Uber''s referral program was a key part of its growth strategy, and how it helped to create a positive feedback loop where new users attracted more users. No-code tools can be useful for building and testing referral programs quickly, which can help startups to identify what works and what doesn''t before investing heavily in custom development.\n\nOverall, while the concept of no-code is not explicitly discussed in "Atomic Network," the ideas presented in this chapter can be useful for startups looking to leverage network effects and build products that quickly attract users. Startups seeking to achieve their objectives can benefit from no-code tools, which enable them [b]to swiftly build and test their ideas[/b] without incurring substantial expenses on custom development.\n\nThe rise of the no-code movement has democratized entrepreneurship and made it easier for startups to build and launch products quickly. These tools and platforms offer a [b]cost-effective and accessible way[/b] to create digital products without the need for coding skills. However, startups should be aware of the limitations of no-code tools and the potential technical debt that they can create.\n\nBy understanding these limitations, startups can leverage no-code tools to scale their business and achieve long-term success.
